This module implements weight stationary, output stationary, Huffman coding and hardware pruning. 
By changing the parameter in testbench, stationary mode can be changed.
The sim folder contains verification data. 
Hardware pruning has four modes: unstructured pruning, block pruning, structured pruning, and no pruning.
